## General info

Deep Learning project from DL Class : these are just notebooks depicting what we learnt in theory, these notebooks were partially empty and students were asked to fill them.

## Technologies

This project was created using:

* Python 3.6.9
* Keras 2.4.3
* Numpy 1.16.4
* Matplotlib 3.3.2

## Setup

Use Jupyter notebook to run each project or run each project using ```python3 project_name.py``` (make sure to have the libraries correctly installed in that case)
